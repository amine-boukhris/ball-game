# ball-game


Building a 2d game using html canvas object and javascript as a scripting language.
This game is inspired from "2 3 4 players" mobile game.
I am building this game in order to shrpen my canvas game development skills and implement the math needed for the logic.
The game is for learning purpose.


I do not take credits for the game idea.
